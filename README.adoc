// =================================================================================================
// Introduction
// =================================================================================================

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to deploy two microservices in Open Liberty containers to a {kube} cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestrator that automates many tasks involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. If you would like to learn more about Kubernetes and how to use it with the Open Liberty Operator, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/openliberty-operator-intro.html[Deploying a microservice to Kubernetes using Open Liberty Operator^] guide.

There are different cloud-based solutions for running your {kube} workloads. A cloud-based infrastructure enables you to focus on developing your microservices without worrying about low-level infrastructure details for deployment. Using a cloud helps
you to easily scale and manage your microservices in a high-availability setup.

Azure offers a managed {kube} service called Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Using AKS simplifies the process of running Kubernetes on Azure without needing to install or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. It provides a hosted {kube} cluster that you can deploy your microservices to. You will use AKS with an Azure Container Registry (ACR). ACR is a private registry that is used to store and distribute your container images. Note, because AKS is not free, a cost may be associated with running this guide. See the official https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/[AKS pricing^] documentation for more details.

This guide will introduce IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on AKS plan, a solution that automates most of the standard steps for provisioning WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on an AKS cluster. Once the initial provisioning is complete, you can further customize your deployments as needed.

The two microservices you will deploy are called `system` and `inventory`. 
The `system` microservice returns the JVM system properties of the running container. 
It also returns the name of the pod in the HTTP header, making replicas easy to distinguish from each other. 
The `inventory` microservice adds the properties from the `system` microservice to the inventory. 
This demonstrates how communication can be established between pods inside a cluster.

== Additional prerequisites

Before you begin, the following additional tools need to be installed:

* *Docker:* You need a containerization software for building containers. Kubernetes 
supports various container types, but you will use Docker in this guide. For installation 
instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker^] documentation.
If you already have Docker installed, make sure to have it running.

* *Azure subscription:* To run this guide, you will need an Azure subscription. Navigate to the 
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/[Microsoft Azure Purchase Options^] 
to create an account with your email and start a Pay-As-You-Go subscription. 

* *IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on AKS plan:* You will need to use the IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on AKS plan on Azure marketplace. See the official
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app?tabs=in-bash#create-a-liberty-on-aks-deployment-using-the-portal[Create a Liberty on AKS deployment using the portal^] documentation for more information. Or, you can go directly to https://aka.ms/liberty-aks[the plan]. To use this plan, you must have one of the following Azure role-based access control sets: Contributor and User Access Administrator together, or Owner of the current subscription.

* *Azure CLI:* You will need to use the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI). See the official
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Install the Azure CLI^]
documentation for information about setting up the Azure CLI for your platform. 
To verify that the Azure CLI is installed correctly, run the following command:


+
[role=command]
```
az --version
```

* *kubectl:* You need the Kubernetes command-line tool `kubectl` to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
If you do not have `kubectl` installed already, use the Azure CLI to download and install `kubectl` with the following command:

[.tab_link.windows_link]
`*WINDOWS*`
[.tab_link.mac_link]
`*MAC*`
[.tab_link.linux_link]
`*LINUX*`

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
az aks install-cli
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
sudo az aks install-cli
```
--

To begin this guide, make sure that you are logged in to Azure to get access to your subscription:

[role=command]
```
az login
```

== Provisioning resources for Liberty on AKS

To deploy your microservices to AKS with Liberty, you need to provision the necessary infrastructure. This involves creating an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to host your microservices and an Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store and manage the container images.

=== Creating a resource group

A resource group is an Azure construct to manage a logical collection of resources for your cloud deployments on Azure. You must create a new resource group to hold and manage the resources you need for your Kubernetes deployment.

To create a resource group efficiently, navigate to the https://aka.ms/liberty-aks[IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on AKS] plan and click **Create** to begin.

In the **Basics** pane, for the **Resource group** field, select **Create new** and enter `guideGroup` as the name of the resource group.

image::AKS_tool_create_resource_group.png[AKS tool create resource group,align="center"]

For the **Region** field, you must specify an Azure location. This location determines where the metadata for your resources is stored. If additional resources are created without specifying a location, they will default to the region you selected for the resource group. Click the **Region** drop-down menu and select the desired location.

image::Region_Selection.png[Region Selection,align="center"]

Note that AKS is not available in all regions. Make sure that the region you select is https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service[compatible with AKS^].

=== Setting up ACR and Kubernetes cluster on AKS

After setting up the resource group, you can leave the remaining configuration at its default settings by skipping the **AKS**, **Load balancing**, and **Operator and application** panes. The default configuration will automatically set up an https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/products/container-registry[Azure Container Registry^] in the same region where your services are deployed, link it to your resource group, create an https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster?tabs=azure-cli[AKS cluster^], and deploy the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator/releases/latest[Open Liberty Operator^] to manage your Open Liberty applications.

For more information on configuring these options, refer to the https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app?tabs=in-bash#create-a-liberty-on-aks-deployment-using-the-portal[Create a Liberty on AKS deployment using the portal] documentation.

Once you have reviewed the configurations, select **Review + create** to validate your setup. After validation, click **Create** to initiate the deployment, which can take up to 20 minutes to complete. You'll see a `Deployment is in progress` message, and when the deployment is complete, a `Your deployment is complete` message will confirm the creation of the ACR and AKS cluster.

== Uploading images to a container registry

Once your Azure Container Registry (ACR) is created, you can proceed to containerize your microservices and upload their Docker images to the ACR for storage and deployment.

=== Logging into the container registry

Before uploading your images, you need to log in to your Azure Container Registry (ACR). Navigate to the resource group overview in the Azure Portal and locate the container registry that was created during the deployment. You will find the registry name listed under the **Name** column.

For example, in the figure below, the registry name is `acrc75e71`.

image::Locate_ACR.png[Locate ACR,align="center"]

You will use this registry name in place of `[registry-name]` in the upcoming commands.

Alternatively, if you prefer using the command line, you can retrieve the container registry information by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
az acr list --resource-group guideGroup --output table
```

This command will return a table with the details of your ACR, including its name. For example, you will see an output similar to the following:

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME       RESOURCE GROUP    LOCATION    SKU    LOGIN SERVER          CREATION DATE         ADMIN ENABLED
---------  ----------------  ----------  -----  --------------------  --------------------  ---------------
acrc75e71  guideGroup        eastus      Basic  acrc75e71.azurecr.io  2024-08-09T17:53:38Z  True
----

Once you have the registry name, log in to your Azure Container Registry using the following command, replacing `[registry-name]` with the name of your container registry:

[role=command]
```
az acr login -n [registry-name]
```

If the login is successful, you will see the following message:

[role="no_copy"]
----
Login Succeeded
----

=== Building your Docker images

The starting Java project, which you can find in the `start` directory, is a multi-module Maven
project. It is made up of the `system` and `inventory` microservices. Each microservice exists in its own directory,
`start/system` and `start/inventory`. Both of these directories contain a Dockerfile, which is necessary
for building the Docker images. If you're unfamiliar with Dockerfiles, check out the
https://openliberty.io/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices^] guide.

Navigate to the `start` directory and run the following command:

[role=command]
```
mvn package
```

Now that your microservices are packaged, you can build the Docker images using the `docker build` commands. Ensure that Docker is installed and the Docker daemon is running before proceeding.

Run the following commands to build and containerize the application:

[role='command']
```
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t system:1.0-SNAPSHOT system/.
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT inventory/.
```

To verify that the images are built, run the `docker images` command to list all local Docker images:

[role='command']
```
docker images
```

Your two images, `system` and `inventory`, should appear in the list of all Docker images:

[role="no_copy"]
----
REPOSITORY    TAG             IMAGE ID        CREATED          SIZE
inventory     1.0-SNAPSHOT    08fef024e986    4 minutes ago    471MB
system        1.0-SNAPSHOT    1dff6d0b4f31    5 minutes ago    470MB
----

=== Pushing the images to a container registry

Pushing the images to a registry allows the cluster to create pods using your container images.

First, retrieve your registry server name. This will typically be in the format `[registry-name].azurecr.io`. You can find this by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
az acr show -n [registry-name] --query loginServer
```

You will see an output similar to the following that will be used to substitute the `[registry-server]` value of the commands in below.

[role="no_copy"]
----
"acr31a3a1.azurecr.io"
----

Tag your container images with your registry by the following commands:

[role=command]
```
docker tag system:1.0-SNAPSHOT [registry-server]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker tag inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT [registry-server]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

Finally, push your images to the registry by the following commands:

[role=command]
```
docker push [registry-server]/system:1.0-SNAPSHOT
docker push [registry-server]/inventory:1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

// =================================================================================================
== Accessing and configuring an AKS cluster

Since your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster is already set up, you can now access and configure it to deploy your microservices.

=== Connecting the AKS cluster to Kubernetes

To manage and interact with your AKS cluster using Kubernetes, you need to integrate the AKS cluster credentials into your local Kubernetes configuration. This allows your local Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) to communicate with the AKS cluster for deploying and managing resources.

To begin, obtain the information about the Kubernetes cluster created within the `guideGroup` resource group. You can do this by either viewing the resource group overview in the Azure Portal or executing the following command:

[role=command]
```
az aks list --resource-group guideGroup --output table
```

The cluster name, formatted as `clusterXXXXXX`, should be identified in the following output.

[role="no_copy"]
----
Name           Location    ResourceGroup    KubernetesVersion    CurrentKubernetesVersion    ProvisioningState    Fqdn
-------------  ----------  ---------------  -------------------  --------------------------  -------------------  -----------------------------------------------
clusterc75e71  eastus      guideGroup       1.29                 1.29.8                      Succeeded            clusterc75e71-dns-pazznf8n.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io
----

Merge the credentials of your cluster into your current Kubernetes configuration by using the `az aks get-credentials` command. Replacing `[cluster-name]` with the name of the cluster. The default Kubernetes configuration file that is updated with your cluster credentials is located within the `~/.kube/config` filepath.

[role=command]
```
az aks get-credentials -g guideGroup -n [cluster-name]
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

[role="no_copy"]
----
Merged [cluster-name] as current context in /Users/.kube/config
----

Run the following command to check the status of the available nodes in your AKS cluster:

[role=command]
```
kubectl get nodes
```

The `kubectl get nodes` command outputs information about the node. Please ensure that the `STATUS` of the node is in the `Ready` state before proceeding with the subsequent steps. 

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
aks-agentpool-15010410-vmss000000   Ready    <none>   65m   v1.29.8
----

=== Storing registry credentials in a secret

To be able to pull the images from your Azure container registry, the credentials of your registry must be added to your service
through a secret. 

View the password for your Azure container registry:

[role=command]
```
az acr credential show -n [registry-name] --query "passwords[0].value" -o tsv
```

Use the `kubectl create secret docker-registry` command to create a secret to hold your registry credentials. 
Replace `[password]` with the registry password that you viewed with the 
`az acr credential show -n [registry-name]` command. The email that is associated with your Docker account replaces `[email-address]`.

[.tab_link.windows_link]
`*WINDOWS*`
[.tab_link.mac_link]
`*MAC*`
[.tab_link.linux_link]
`*LINUX*`

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role='command']
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry guidesecret ^
    --docker-server=[registry-server] ^
    --docker-username=[registry-name] ^
    --docker-password=[password] ^
    --docker-email=[email-address]
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role='command']
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry guidesecret \
    --docker-server=[registry-server] \
    --docker-username=[registry-name] \
    --docker-password=[password] \
    --docker-email=[email-address]
```
--

The secret is successfully created with the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
secret/guidesecret created
----

// Deploying microservices to AKS
// =================================================================================================
== Deploying microservices to AKS

Now that your container images are built and your Kubernetes cluster is ready, you can deploy your microservices using the Open Liberty Operator. 

=== Creating a deployment definition

The Open Liberty Operator provides custom resource definitions (CRDs) that allow you to define how your Open Liberty applications are deployed. These CRDs are described in a `yaml` file, which outlines the deployment details and services required for your application. All resources can also be deleted from the cluster by using the same `yaml` file that you used to deploy them. The [hotspot]`deploy.yaml` resource definition file is provided for you. If you are interested in learning more about deploying microservices using the Open Liberty Operator, check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/openliberty-operator-intro.html[Deploying a microservice to Kubernetes using Open Liberty Operator^] guide.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `deploy.yaml` file in the `start` directory.#
`deploy.yaml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Replace [hotspot=sysImage hotspot=invImage file=0]`[registry-server]` with your container registry server.
You can get the login server for your registry by running the `az acr show -n [registry-name] --query loginServer` command.

deploy.yaml
[source, Text, linenums, indent=0, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/deploy.yaml[]
----

In the [hotspot]`deploy.yaml` file, the custom resource (CR) is specified to be [hotspot=sysCr hotspot=invCr file=0]`OpenLibertyApplication`. The [hotspot=sysImage hotspot=invImage file=0]`applicationImage` is the name and tag of the container image that you want 
to use for the container. The [hotspot]`deploy.yaml` file references the images that you pushed to your registry
for the [hotspot=sysImage file=0]`system` and [hotspot=invImage file=0]`inventory` repositories. These images can be pulled
with the [hotspot=sysSecret hotspot=invSecret file=0]`secret` that you defined before.

The service that is used to expose your deployments has a type of [hotspot=sysLoadBalancer hotspot=invLoadBalancer file=0]`LoadBalancer`. 
This means you can access these services from IP addresses that forward incoming traffic to your nodepool via a specific port.
You can expose your services in other ways such as using a `NodePort` service type. 

=== Deploying your application

To deploy your microservices to Azure Kubernetes Service, you need Kubernetes to create
the contents of the [hotspot]`deploy.yaml` file. 

Run the following command to deploy the resources defined in the [hotspot]`deploy.yaml` file:

[role='command']
```
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
```

You will see an output similar to the following:

[role="no_copy"]
----
openlibertyapplication.apps.openliberty.io/system-deployment created
openlibertyapplication.apps.openliberty.io/inventory-deployment created
----

Run the following command to check the status of your pods:
[role='command']
```
kubectl get pods
```

If all the pods are healthy and running, you see an output similar to the following:
[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
inventory-deployment-5d6bcf79bc-nm6bm   1/1     Running   0          33s
system-deployment-f7757c55-2t7mk        1/1     Running   0          35s
----

=== Making requests to the microservices

You need the external IP addresses that are associated with the `system` and `inventory` services to try out your microservices.

Take note of the `EXTERNAL-IP` in the output of the following commands. It is the 
hostname that you will later substitute into `[EXTERNAL-IP]` to access the `system` and `inventory` services.

View the information of the `system` service to see its `EXTERNAL-IP` address:

[role='command']
```
kubectl get service/system-deployment
```

You need to wait a while for the `EXTERNAL-IP` to change from `<pending>` to an IP address.

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
system-deployment   LoadBalancer   10.0.162.69    <pending>     9080:30260/TCP   3s
----

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
system-deployment   LoadBalancer   10.0.162.69   135.237.37.69   9080:32480/TCP   16s
----

View the information of the `inventory` service to see its `EXTERNAL-IP` address:

[role='command']
```
kubectl get service/inventory-deployment
```

You will need to wait a while for the `EXTERNAL-IP` to change from `<pending>` to an IP address.

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
inventory-deployment   LoadBalancer   10.0.96.147   <pending>     9081:30431/TCP   2s
----

[role="no_copy"]
----
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
inventory-deployment   LoadBalancer   10.0.96.147   135.237.38.19    9081:30431/TCP   74s
----

To access your microservices, point your browser to the following URLs, substituting the appropriate `EXTERNAL-IP` hostnames
for the `system` and `inventory` services:

* `{system-api}`
* `{inventory-api}`

In the first URL, you see a result in JSON format with the system properties of the container JVM.
The second URL returns an empty list, which is expected because no system properties are stored in the inventory yet. 

Point your browser to the `{inventory-api}/[system-EXTERNAL-IP]` URL. When you visit this URL, these system
properties are automatically stored in the inventory. Go back to `{inventory-api}` and
you see a new entry for `[system-EXTERNAL-IP]`.

// =================================================================================================
// Testing the microservices
// =================================================================================================

== Testing the microservices

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functionality of the microservices. 
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code. 
To run the tests, wait for all pods to be in the ready state before you proceed further.

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/pom.xml[]
----

The default properties that are defined in the [hotspot file=0]`pom.xml` file are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Property*                      | *Description*
| [hotspot=sysKubeService file=0]`system.ip` | Name of the {kube} Service wrapping the `system` pods, `system-service` by default.
| [hotspot=invKubeService file=0]`inventory.ip` | Name of the {kube} Service wrapping the `inventory` pods, `inventory-service` by default.
| [hotspot=sysHttpPort file=0]`sys.http.port`    | The HTTP port for the {kube} Service `system-service`, 9080 by default.
| [hotspot=invHttpPort file=0]`inv.http.port`    | The HTTP port of the {kube} Service `inventory-service`, 9081 by default.
|===


=== Running the tests

Run the Maven `failsafe:integration-test` goal to test your microservices by replacing `[system-EXTERNAL-IP]` and `[inventory-EXTERNAL-IP]`
with the values that were determined in the previous section.

[role='command']
```
mvn failsafe:integration-test -Dsystem.ip=[system-EXTERNAL-IP] -Dinventory.ip=[inventory-EXTERNAL-IP]
```

If the tests pass, you will see an output similar to the following for each service:

== Tearing down the environment

It is important to clean up your resources when you are finished with the guide so that you do not incur extra charges for ongoing usage.

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete all {kube} resources 
by running the `kubectl delete` command:

[role='command']
```
kubectl delete -f deploy.yaml
```

Because you are done testing your cluster, clean up all of its related sources using the `az group delete` command.
This command removes the resource group, container service, and all related resources:

[role='command']
```
az group delete -g guideGroup --yes --no-wait
```

// =================================================================================================
// finish
// =================================================================================================

== Great work! You're done!

You have just deployed two microservices running in Open Liberty to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You also
